ðŸ¤– TASK 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Docker Container Provisioning

Objective

This project successfully demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by using Terraform to provision and manage a local Docker container running the Nginx web server. The primary goal was to ensure end-to-end management, including initialization, planning, application, state checking, and destruction of the infrastructure, using industry best practices.

ðŸš€ Execution Instructions

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure Terraform (v1.13+) and Docker Desktop are installed and running.

Initialize: Navigate to the project folder and run:

terraform init


Plan (Safety Check): Review the plan to confirm 1 resource will be added:

terraform plan


Apply (Build): Provision the container. Type yes when prompted. The Nginx server will be accessible at http://localhost:8081.

terraform apply


State Check: Verify Terraform is managing the resources:

terraform state list


Destroy (Cleanup): Safely remove the infrastructure. Type yes when prompted.

terraform destroy
